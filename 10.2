10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.



name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
dic={}
tup=list()
for line in handle:    #parsing through file
    if line.startswith("From "):
        x=line.strip().split()
        y=x[5]                   #extracting hours
        z= y.split(":")
        hour=z[0]
        if hour in dic:        #putting hour and count in dic
            dic[hour]=dic[hour]+1
        else:
                dic[hour]=1
    else:
        continue
for k,v in dic.items():       #creating a tuple and appending key and values from dic
        tup.append((k,v))
        tup.sort()
for hour, count in tup:  #printing sorted elements in tuple
        print(hour, count)
