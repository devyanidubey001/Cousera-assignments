Handling The Data
The basic outline of this problem is to read the file, look for integers using the re.findall(), looking for a regular expression of '[0-9]+' and then converting the extracted strings to integers and summing up the integers.






import re
file = open("regex_sum_1216654.txt")
y=[]
total=0
for line in file:
    x= re.findall('([0-9]+)', line) 
    if len(x)<1 : continue
    for i in range(len(x)):  #converting string elements to int
        x[i]=int(x[i])
    y= x+y
for ele in range(len(y)): #adding all the elements in the list y
    total=total+y[ele]
print(total)
